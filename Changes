    • In sync mode,  local files that had not been modified would  be
      scanned for links,  even if they were binary  files;  now  such
      files are simply skipped.
    • Makefile.PL  has been fixed so that  the  dummy.pm  file is  no
      longer installed.
    • Binary files are now downloaded straight to disk,  and  are  no
      longer kept in memory.
